### Model architecture
![examples](./examples/network.png)

### Experimental results with state-of-the art methods on the GOPRO dataset
![examples](./examples/results1.png)
Several results of single image deblurring. First row : input blurry images selected from the GOPRO dataset. Second row : deblurring results by Tao et al. Third row : deblurring result by Zhang et al. Fourth row : deblurring results by the proposed method. Note that blurred regions (red and yellow-colored rectangles) are enlarged for better view. Best views in colors.

### Experimental results with state-of-the art methods on the Köhler dataset
![examples](./examples/results2.PNG)
Several results of single image deblurring. First column : input blurry images selected from the Köhler dataset. Second column : deblurring results by Nah et al. Third column : deblurring result by Zhang et al. Fourth column : deblurring results by the proposed method. Note that all experiments are conducted with parameters, which are trained based on the GOPRO dataset, without any modification.
